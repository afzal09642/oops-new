        "#1. What is Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)?\n",
        "- Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) is a programming paradigm that uses \"objects\" to represent data and methods to manipulate that data. It emphasizes the concepts of encapsulation, inheritance, polymorphism, and abstraction to create modular and reusable code. In OOP, objects are instances of classes, which define the structure and behavior of the objects. This approach helps in organizing code, making it easier to maintain and extend.        \n",
        "\n",
        "#2.What is a class in OOP?\n",
        "- A class in Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) is a blueprint or template for creating objects. It defines the properties (attributes) and behaviors (methods) that the objects created from the class will have. A class encapsulates data and functions that operate on that data, allowing for the creation of multiple instances (objects) that share the same structure and behavior defined by the class. Classes help in organizing code, promoting reusability, and implementing OOP principles such as encapsulation and inheritance.  \n",
        "\n",
        "#3.what is an object in OOP?\n",
        "- An object in Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) is an instance of a class that encapsulates data and behavior. It represents a specific entity that combines attributes (data) and methods (functions) defined by its class. Objects can interact with one another through their methods, allowing for the implementation of OOP principles such as encapsulation, inheritance, and polymorphism. Each object has its own state, defined by the values of its attributes, and can perform actions through its methods.\n",
        "\n",
        "#4. What is the difference between abstraction and encapsulation?\n",
        "- Abstraction and encapsulation are two fundamental concepts in Object-Oriented Programming (OOP), but they serve different purposes:\n",
        "  Abstraction is the concept of hiding the complex implementation details and showing only the essential features of the object. It helps in reducing complexity and increasing efficiency by allowing the programmer to focus on interactions at a higher level.\n",
        "  Encapsulation, on the other hand, is the bundling of data (attributes) and methods (functions) that operate on that data within a single unit (class). It restricts direct access to some of the object's components, which is a means of preventing unintended interference and misuse of the methods and data.        \n",
        "\n",
        "#5.What are dunder methods in Python?\n",
        "- Dunder methods, short for \"double underscore\" methods, are special methods in Python that have names that begin and end with double underscores (e.g., __init__, __str__, __add__). These methods are also known as magic methods or special methods. They allow developers to define the behavior of objects for built-in operations, such as initialization, string representation, arithmetic operations, and more. By implementing dunder methods in a class, you can customize how instances of that class behave in various contexts, making your classes more intuitive and integrated with Python's syntax and built-in functions.    \n",
        "\n",
        " #6.  Explain the concept of inheritance in OOP.\n",
        " - Inheritance is a fundamental concept in Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) that allows a new class (called a subclass or derived class) to inherit properties and behaviors (attributes and methods) from an existing class (called a superclass or base class). This promotes code reusability and establishes a hierarchical relationship between classes. The subclass can extend or override the functionality of the superclass, enabling the creation of more specialized classes without duplicating code. Inheritance supports the principles of polymorphism and encapsulation, making it easier to manage and maintain complex systems.\n",
        "\n",
        "#7.What is polymorphism in OOP?\n",
        "-  Polymorphism in Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) is the ability of different classes to be treated as instances of the same class through a common interface. It allows methods to do different things based on the object that it is acting upon, even though they share the same name. Polymorphism enables a single function or method to operate in different ways depending on the type of object it is called on, promoting flexibility and scalability in code design. This concept is often implemented through method overriding and interfaces, allowing for dynamic method resolution at runtime.\n",
        "\n",
        "#8.How is encapsulation achieved in Python?\n",
        "- Encapsulation in Python is achieved by restricting access to certain components of an object and bundling data (attributes) and methods (functions) within a class. This is typically done using naming conventions and access modifiers. In Python, a single underscore prefix (e.g., _attribute) indicates that an attribute or method is intended for internal use (protected), while a double underscore prefix (e.g., __attribute) triggers name mangling, making it harder to access from outside the class (private). Encapsulation helps protect the internal state of an object and prevents unintended interference, promoting modularity and maintainability in code design. Example of encapsulation in Python\n",

        "\n",
        "#9.What is a constructor in Python OOP?\n",
        "- A constructor in Python OOP is a special method that is automatically called when an object of a class is created. It is used to initialize the attributes of the object and set up any necessary state. In Python, the constructor method is defined using the __init__() method. The __init__() method can take parameters to allow for the customization of object creation. It is a fundamental part of the class definition and helps ensure that objects are properly initialized when they are instantiated.\n",
        "\n",
        " #10. What are class and static methods in Python OOP?\n",
        "- Class methods and static methods are two types of methods in Python OOP that are associated with a class rather than an instance of the class.\n",
        " - Class Methods: Class methods are defined using the @classmethod decorator and take the class itself as the first parameter (usually named cls). They can access and modify class-level data and are often used for factory methods that create instances of the class.\n",
        " - Static Methods: Static methods are defined using the @staticmethod decorator and do not take either the instance (self) or the class (cls) as the first parameter. They behave like regular functions but belong to the class's namespace. Static methods are used for utility functions that do not need to access or modify class or instance data.\n",
        "\n",
        "#11.What is method overloading in Python OOP?\n",
        "- Method overloading in Python OOP refers to the ability to define multiple methods with the same   name but with different parameters (different number or types of arguments) within the same class. However, Python does not support method overloading in the traditional sense as seen in some other programming languages. Instead, Python allows you to achieve similar functionality by using default arguments or variable-length arguments (*args and **kwargs) in a single method definition. This way, you can handle different types or numbers of inputs within the same method.\n",
        "\n",
        "#12.What is method overriding in OOP?\n",
        "- Method overriding in Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) is a feature that allows a subclass to provide a specific implementation of a method that is already defined in its superclass. When a method in a subclass has the same name, return type, and parameters as a method in the superclass, the subclass's method overrides the superclass's method. This allows for dynamic polymorphism, where the appropriate method is called based on the object's actual type at runtime, enabling more specialized behavior in subclasses while maintaining a consistent interface.\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "#13.What is a property decorator in Python?\n",
        "- A property decorator in Python is a built-in decorator that allows you to define methods in a class that can be accessed like attributes. It is used to create managed attributes, enabling you to add logic for getting, setting, and deleting an attribute while keeping the syntax simple and intuitive. The @property decorator is used to define a getter method, and you can use the @<property_name>.setter and @<property_name>.deleter decorators to define setter and deleter methods, respectively. This helps in encapsulating the internal representation of an attribute while providing a clean interface for users of the class.\n",

        " #14. Why is polymorphism important in OOP?\n",
        "- Polymorphism is important in Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) because it enhances flexibility, maintainability, and scalability of code. It allows objects of different classes to be treated as instances of a common superclass, enabling a single interface to represent different underlying forms (data types). This leads to several benefits:\n",
        " 1. Code Reusability: Polymorphism allows for the reuse of code by enabling functions and methods to operate on different object types without modification.\n",
        " 2. Simplified Code: It reduces complexity by allowing the same method or function to handle different data types, leading to cleaner and more understandable code.\n",
        " 3. Easier Maintenance: Changes to the code can be made in one place (the superclass) without affecting the subclasses, making it easier to maintain and update the codebase.\n",
        " 4. Extensibility: New classes can be added with minimal changes to existing code, facilitating the extension of functionality without disrupting existing implementations.\n",
        " Overall, polymorphism is a key principle of OOP that promotes code efficiency and adaptability in software development.   \n",

        "#15.What is an abstract class in Python OOP?\n",
        "- An abstract class in Python OOP is a class that cannot    be instantiated on its own and is meant to be subclassed. It serves as a blueprint for other classes and can define abstract methods that must be implemented by any concrete subclass. Abstract classes are created using the abc (Abstract Base Classes) module, and they help enforce a certain interface or contract for subclasses, ensuring that they provide specific functionality. Abstract classes promote code organization, reusability, and adherence to design principles in OOP.     \n",

        "- A class variable and an instance variable are two types of variables used in Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) to store data, but they differ in their scope and behavior:\n",
        " - Class Variable: A class variable is shared among all instances of a class. It is defined within the class but outside any instance methods. Class variables are used to store data that is common to all instances of the class. Changes made to a class variable affect all instances of the class.\n",
        " - Instance Variable: An instance variable is unique to each instance of a class. It is defined within instance methods (usually in the __init__ method) and is prefixed with self. Instance variables store data that is specific to a particular object. Changes made to an instance variable only affect that specific instance and do not impact other instances of the class.\n",

        "#18.What is multiple inheritance in Python?\n",
        "- Multiple inheritance is a feature of Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) in Python where a class can inherit attributes and methods from more than one parent class. This allows for the creation of a new class that combines the functionality of multiple base classes. Multiple inheritance can be useful for creating complex class hierarchies and promoting code reuse. However, it can also lead to complications, such as the \"Diamond Problem,\" where the method resolution order (MRO) becomes ambiguous. Python addresses this issue using the C3 linearization algorithm to determine the order in which base classes are searched when a method is called.\n",

        "- The __str__ and __repr__ methods in Python OOP are special dunder methods that define how objects of a class are represented as strings.\n",
        " - __str__ Method: The __str__ method is intended to provide a \"pretty\" or user-friendly string representation of an object. It is called by the built-in str() function and the print() function. The output of __str__ is meant to be readable and informative for end-users.\n",
        " - __repr__ Method: The __repr__ method is intended to provide an \"official\" string representation of an object that can be used for debugging and development. It is called by the built-in repr() function and is meant to be unambiguous, often including information that can help recreate the object. The output of __repr__ is typically more detailed and technical than that of __str__.\n",

        "#20.What is the significance of the ‘super()’ function in Python OOP?\n",
        "- The super() function in Python OOP is used to call methods from a parent class (superclass) in a subclass. It provides a way to access inherited methods and properties without explicitly naming the parent class, which is especially useful in the context of multiple inheritance. The super() function helps to ensure that the correct method resolution order (MRO) is followed, allowing for cleaner and more maintainable code. It is commonly used in the __init__ method of a subclass to initialize the parent class's attributes before adding subclass-specific attributes.\n",

The __del__ method can be useful for managing resources that need explicit cleanup before an object is removed from memory. However, its use is generally discouraged unless absolutely necessary, as the timing of its execution is not guaranteed, and it can lead to complications if not handled carefully.    \n",
